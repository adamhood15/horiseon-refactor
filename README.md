# Module-1-Challenge-Horiseon

## Description
This project is the first challenge of my Rice Coding Bootcamp. The main goal of the project was to refactor the code so that it follows accessibility standards to optimize the site for search engines. I also consolidated some css elements and attributes, changed some elements to semantic html elements, fixed broken links, and restructured the code to follow more logical structure. I learned a lot about how to properly structure HTML, and CSS files as well as how to improve accessibility.
